A program for configuring a computer based on existing components.
There are 2 types of assembly: manual and automatic: 
  1. Manual. Manual allows you to select each component yourself, determine the number of required hard drives and RAM sticks. Moreover, when choosing a         motherboard, only compatible components will be displayed to you.
  2. Automatic allows you to combine randomly selected components without conflicts and errors caused by mismatched characteristics.
